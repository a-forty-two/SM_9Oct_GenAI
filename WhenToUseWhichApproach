1. I know ML and I know how to code and I know business 
                1. TF/libraries/Spark 
                2. AutoML-> 
                            1. AutoML -> tells me model explainability -> how was model built?
                                        1. Hyperparameter tuning 
                                                    1. HP-> factors that developers control -> how long to train? LR?
2. I know ML but I donâ€™t know to code and I know business 
            1. AutoML on cloud-> No CODE
            2. Machine Learning pipelines-> FLOWCHART-> at least outline of ML process 
                            1. Microsoft Azure (No Code ML Pipelines)
3. I only know code
                1. Pre-build AI APIs-> Vision, NLP
                2. AutoML -> dataset + machines= distributed FOR loop-> one model will outperform all the others (Scikit-learn)
                3. KubeFlow (ML on Kubernetes) / MLFlow (Kubeflow on databricks/spark/clouds)-> need to know kubernetes/containers
